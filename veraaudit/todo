Need to fix timezone conversion as currently incorrect

update the file name to use the newest UTC timestamp from logs retrieved

function to take the oldest log entry UTC timestamp and then find the files that has a newer timestamp

Load log sha256 from the auditlog files and compare with new log files sha256 entry to look for duplicates and exclude the log from being written out
